# 👋 Welcome, curious traveler...

They call me **@NonMolto** — a name that whispers "not much"... but don't be fooled.

- 👁‍🗨 What catches my eye? The invisible elegance of code, the silence between logic and chaos.
- 🌒 Currently wandering the realms of **C#** and the arcane arts of the web.
- 🤝 I seek to understand this vast universe, to forge digital relics — ideas that echo beyond the terminal.
- 📫 I whisper into the void: nonmolto.dev [at] email.com
- 😶‍🌫️ Pronouns: he/him — although code has no gender.
- 🕯️ Fun fact: I prefer shadows (backstage... at the moment) to spotlights... but even shadows need light to exist.
